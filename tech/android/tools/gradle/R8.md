# R8
## 功能
New code shrinker R8   
- R8 is a new tool for code shrinking and obfuscation that replaces ProGuard.   
- You can start using the preview version of R8 by including the following in your project’s `gradle.properties` :`android.enableR8 = true`
- R8 integrates desugaring, shrinking, obfuscating, optimizing, and dexing all in one step—resulting in noticeable build performance improvements. 
- In `Android Gradle plugin 3.3.0`, R8 was introduced.
- In `Android Gradle plugin >=3.4.0`, R8 was `default enabled` for  for both app and Android library projects.
- Java8

## disable R8 when experience issues using R8

`gradle.properties`  
```
# Disables R8 for Android Library modules only.
android.enableR8.libraries = false

# Disables R8 for all modules.
android.enableR8 = false
```

> Note:   
For a given build type, if set useProguard to false in app module's build.gradle file, the Android Gradle plugin uses R8 to shrink app's code for that build type, regardless of whether you disable R8 in your project's gradle.properties file.
